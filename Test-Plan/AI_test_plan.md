  <i>Prepared by: Atif Mahmood | QA Engineer</i><br>
  <i>📅 Duration: May 2024 – February 2025</i>
</p>

---

## 🎯 1. Objective

This test plan outlines the QA strategy for **Covertly.ai**, a secure AI assistant platform that allows anonymous users to interact with multiple LLMs, receive unified “Super Responses,” and generate images using **Stable Diffusion** and **DALL·E**.

The objective is to validate all major functionalities, ensure system reliability, and maintain high-quality user experience across devices and browsers.

---

## 🧪 2. Scope of Testing

- 🔐 Anonymous prompt flow with LLM access  
- 🧠 “Super Response” logic combining multi-model outputs  
- 🖼️ Image generation using Stable Diffusion and DALL·E  
- 🔄 Prompt history and API response validation  
- 📱 Web-based UI and user session testing  
- 🧬 Integration between frontend, API, and AI models

---

## 🧰 3. Types of Testing

- ✅ Functional Testing  
- 🔁 Regression Testing  
- 🔍 Smoke & Sanity Testing  
- 📬 API Testing (Postman & Swagger)  
- 🧪 UI/UX and Cross-Browser Testing  
- 🔄 Data Flow Validation
